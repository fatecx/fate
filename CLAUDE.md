# CLAUDE.md — fate

Narrative founder-saga game (fate.cx). Design phase — read `DESIGN.md` before any work; it is the source of truth for systems and content. Agent rules in `AGENTS.md` apply here in full.

## What this is

One persistent biography: you are a startup founder in a near-future world of AI-run corporations. Found four companies in fixed sequence — **HYPERCHUTE → TELEPORT → SKYLINE → ESCAPE** — carrying reputation, relationships, cap table history, and scars across every death and exit. Citizen Sleeper is the quality bar: deterministic mechanics, authored narrative, constant near-scarcity.

## Non-negotiables

- Engine = pure deterministic TS; LLM renders prose from true state only (never outcomes/numbers).
- Content lives as typed data files; scenario-graph completeness is enforced by vitest.
- Game must be fully playable as text at all times — art never blocks.
- Runway / Stress / Reputation are the only meters.
- Donor repo for auth/wallet scaffold: `~/.superset/projects/terminus` (read-only).

## Current phase

Docs + design only. Next milestone: Phase 1 — deterministic engine core + Chapter One content schema (`src/engine`, `src/content`) with graph-validation tests. No UI until the engine simulates a full life headlessly.
